# Einundzwanzig Community Bot

Einundzwanzig Community Telegram Bot

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) library
- A Telegram Bot token, can be retrieved from [Bot Father](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)

## Local development and deployment

You can create a Python3 virtual environment using

```shell
python3 -m venv env # Install virtual environment
source env/bin/activate # Activate virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install dependencies
```

Make sure your virtual environment is activated every time you run the bot.
You can get out of the virtual environment by running `deactivate` inside the environment.

Afterwards you can run the bot with

```python
BOT_TOKEN=*** python src/main.py
```

The bot will start up and automatically receive updates and respond to messages.

## Docker

You can also use docker for local development and/or deployment, see the
`Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for details

## Webhook

If you want to set up a webhook for the bot you need to specify the following environment variables:

- `USE_WEBHOOK` True if you want to use webhooks
- `WEBHOOK_URL` FQDN of the server (e.g. example.com, 8.8.8.8)
- `WEBHOOK_PORT` Port to use, can be any of 80, 88, 443, 8443

Make sure you create a self-signed certifcate first and place them in the root folder.
The key must be named `private.key` and the cert `cert.pem`.

If you are using docker, the certificate will be generated for you.
Have a look at the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for more details.
